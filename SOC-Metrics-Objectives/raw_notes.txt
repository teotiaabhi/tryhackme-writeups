🧠 SOC Main Goal

Protect:

Confidentiality

Integrity

Availability

SOC workflow:
Alert → L1 triage → Escalation → Containment

📊 SOC Performance Metrics
1️⃣ Alerts Count (AC)

AC = Total Alerts Received

Measures:

SOC workload

Ideal:
5–30 alerts per day per L1

Too High:

Analyst fatigue

Missed threats

Too Low:

Detection failure

SIEM visibility issue

2️⃣ False Positive Rate (FPR)

FPR = False Positives / Total Alerts

Example:
40 false out of 50 alerts → 80%

High FPR causes:

Alert fatigue

Poor vigilance

Risk of missing real threats

Fix:

Tune detection rules

Exclude IT/system noise

Automate repetitive triage

3️⃣ Alert Escalation Rate (AER)

AER = Escalated Alerts / Total Alerts

Measures:

L1 confidence level

Too High:

L1 lacks experience

Too Low:

Overconfidence

Missed threats

Target:
Below 50% (preferably below 20%)

4️⃣ Threat Detection Rate (TDR)

TDR = Detected Threats / Total Threats

Measures:

SOC effectiveness

Ideal:
100%

Missed threats = severe business impact

⏱ SLA Metrics
MTTD – Mean Time to Detect

Time between attack and alert generation

Tool performance metric

MTTA – Mean Time to Acknowledge

Time between alert generation and L1 starting triage

L1 responsibility metric

MTTR – Mean Time to Respond

Time between detection and containment

SOC operational maturity metric

🔧 Improving Metrics

High FPR:

False positive remediation

Detection rule tuning

Remove IT noise

High MTTD:

Tune detection rule frequency

Check real-time log ingestion

High MTTA:

Improve notifications

Balance analyst workload

High MTTR:

Create workbooks

Improve escalation process

Document response steps
