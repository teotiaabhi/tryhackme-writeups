SOC Alert Triage – Study Notes
Overview

This room focuses on understanding how alerts are generated, prioritised, and triaged inside a Security Operations Center (SOC). It covers the operational workflow followed by SOC L1 analysts when handling alerts inside a SIEM dashboard.

1. From Events to Alerts
Event → Log → Alert Flow

Event occurs

User login

Process execution

File download

Network connection

System generates logs

OS logs

Firewall logs

Cloud logs

Application logs

Logs sent to security platform

SIEM

EDR

NDR

Detection rule triggers

If rule condition matches log pattern

Alert is created

Purpose of alerts:
Reduce millions of logs into manageable suspicious items for analysts.

2. Alert Management Platforms
SIEM

Central log aggregation

Rule-based detection

Alert dashboard

EDR / NDR

Endpoint or network focused detection

Often integrated with SIEM

SOAR

Automates response

Uses playbooks

ITSM

Ticket management

Alert tracking and ownership

3. Alert Properties (Important for Triage)
1. Alert Time

When alert was created

May differ from actual event time

2. Alert Name

Detection rule name

Summary of suspicious activity

Examples:

Unusual VPN Login Location

Double Extension File Creation

Potential Data Exfiltration

3. Alert Severity

Low

Medium

High

Critical

Severity defines urgency.

4. Alert Status

New

In Progress

Closed

Custom statuses

5. Alert Verdict

True Positive (Real threat)

False Positive (Benign activity)

6. Alert Assignee

Analyst responsible for investigation

7. Alert Description

Includes:

Detection logic

Why activity is suspicious

Optional triage guidance

8. Alert Fields (Indicators)

Examples:

Username

Hostname

IP address

File path

Process name

Hash

URL

These are the core investigation data points.

4. Alert Prioritisation

When multiple alerts exist:

Step 1 – Filter

Only take:

New

Unassigned

Awaiting action

Do not take:

Closed

Already In Progress

Step 2 – Sort by Severity

Order:

Critical

High

Medium

Low

Step 3 – Sort by Time

If same severity:

Oldest first

Reason:
Older breach may already be progressing.

Priority Formula:

Severity > Time > Ownership

5. Alert Triage Workflow

Alert triage = structured investigation process.

Phase 1 – Initial Actions

Prioritise alert

Assign to yourself

Move to “In Progress”

Read alert name & description

Identify key fields (user, host, IP, file, process)

Phase 2 – Investigation
Step 1: Identify Who is at Risk

Which user?

Which host?

Is it privileged account?

Is it sensitive department?

Step 2: Understand What Happened

Was it:

Suspicious login?

Malware?

Phishing?

Data exfiltration?

Step 3: Check Surrounding Events

Look for:

Activity before alert

Activity after alert

Lateral movement

File execution

Data transfer

Golden rule:
Alerts rarely exist in isolation.

Step 4: Use Threat Intelligence

Check file hash reputation

Check IP reputation

Check domain reputation

6. Making the Final Decision

After investigation, decide:

False Positive

Legitimate user activity

VPN/travel explanation

IT administrative activity

No malicious follow-up behavior

True Positive

Confirmed malware

Suspicious login + malicious behavior

Data exfiltration

Credential dumping tools detected

7. Writing Investigation Comment

Comment should include:

What was detected

What was reviewed

Key findings

Final verdict

Justification

Example Structure:

Alert reviewed

User login analysed

No suspicious follow-up activity

IP belongs to corporate VPN

Verdict: False Positive

8. Escalation Logic

Escalate to L2 when:

Confirmed compromise

Advanced attack techniques

Privileged account involved

Scope exceeds L1 authority

9. Closing the Alert

Final steps:

Set verdict

Add detailed comment

Move status to Closed

If values are incorrect:

No completion flag will be generated

Key Concepts Summary

Event → Log → Detection Rule → Alert

Alert prioritisation prevents missing critical threats

Severity determines urgency

Triage requires structured thinking

Always document investigation

Evidence-based decision making is mandatory

Core SOC L1 Mindset

Do not assume

Do not panic

Follow structured workflow

Investigate surrounding context

Justify every verdict
