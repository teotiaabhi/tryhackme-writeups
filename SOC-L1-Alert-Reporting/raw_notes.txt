===============================
ALERT LIFECYCLE AFTER TRIAGE
===============================

L1 receives alerts
↓
Triage (True/False Positive)
↓
Report Writing
↓
Escalation (if required)
↓
L2 Deep Investigation
↓
Remediation / Incident Response

================================
WHY L1 REPORTING IS IMPORTANT
================================

1. Provides context for escalation
   - Saves L2 time
   - Prevents re-investigation

2. Preserves evidence
   - Raw logs retained 3–12 months
   - Alerts stored indefinitely
   - Reports act as audit records

3. Improves investigation skills
   - Forces structured thinking
   - Enhances analytical clarity

=====================
5W REPORT STRUCTURE
=====================

WHO:
- Affected user
- Privilege level

WHAT:
- Exact action performed
- Commands executed
- Files downloaded

WHEN:
- Start and end time
- Timezone

WHERE:
- Hostname
- IP address
- Domain
- URL

WHY:
- Reasoning behind verdict
- Evidence supporting True/False Positive

=====================
ESCALATION CRITERIA
=====================

Escalate when:

- Confirmed compromise
- Malware execution
- Lateral movement
- Data exfiltration
- Privileged account involved
- Remediation required
- External communication required
- Analyst unsure

=====================
ESCALATION STEPS
=====================

1. Move alert to In Progress
2. Complete investigation
3. Write structured report
4. Set verdict (True Positive)
5. Reassign to L2
6. Notify L2

=====================
L1 vs L2
=====================

L1:
- Triage
- Basic investigation
- Documentation

L2:
- Deep analysis
- Containment
- Remediation
- Incident Response

=====================
KEY SKILLS GAINED
=====================

- Structured alert reporting
- Escalation judgment
- Incident documentation
- Communication discipline
- SOC workflow understanding
