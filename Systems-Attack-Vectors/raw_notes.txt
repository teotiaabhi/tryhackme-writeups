Systems as Attack Vectors — Raw Notes
1. Systems as Critical Attack Targets

A system is any device, server, or infrastructure component that stores, processes, or manages data.

Examples of systems include:

Physical servers

Virtual machines

Cloud platforms (Microsoft 365, AWS, Google Cloud)

Email servers

Database servers

Employee laptops

Web servers

Systems are high-value targets because compromising a system gives attackers access to sensitive data, multiple users, and internal infrastructure.

Compromising one user gives limited access, but compromising a system gives large-scale control.

Example:
Compromising one mailbox affects one user
Compromising mail server affects thousands of users

2. Attacker Goal: Initial Access

The first step in most attacks is gaining access to a system.

Once attackers gain access, they can:

Steal sensitive data

Install malware or ransomware

Gain administrator privileges

Move laterally within network

Destroy or encrypt data

This phase is called initial access.

3. Human-Led System Attacks

Many system compromises begin with human mistakes.

Examples include:

Weak passwords
Password reuse
Inserting malicious USB devices
Downloading malicious software

Statistics show that 81% of breaches involve weak or stolen passwords.

Weak password example:

"tryhackme"

If password exists in data breaches, attackers can use it to gain access.

Rubber Ducky USB attack example:

Rubber Ducky is a malicious USB device that executes commands automatically when inserted.

It can install malware and give attackers access to the system.

4. Software Vulnerabilities

Software vulnerabilities are weaknesses in software that attackers exploit.

Every software contains vulnerabilities.

Some vulnerabilities exist for many years before discovery.

Example:
Shellshock vulnerability existed from 1992 to 2014.

Zero-day vulnerability is a vulnerability unknown to vendor and public.

Attackers exploit zero-day vulnerabilities before patches are available.

Once vulnerability is discovered, it receives a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) ID.

Example:
CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue)
CVE-2021-34527 (PrintNightmare)

Patch is the official fix released by vendor to correct vulnerability.

Patch management is critical to prevent exploitation.

5. Misconfigurations

Misconfiguration is a security weakness caused by incorrect system setup.

Misconfiguration is not a software bug, but a human configuration mistake.

Examples include:

Weak passwords
Default credentials
Disabled firewall
Exposed database to internet
Open cloud storage

Example attack scenario:

Database installed securely
Admin sets weak password "1111"
Firewall disabled
Database exposed to internet
Attackers access database and steal data

Misconfigurations are common causes of breaches.

6. Supply Chain Attacks

Supply chain attacks target trusted software, libraries, or vendors.

Attackers compromise software vendor and distribute malicious updates.

Users install update thinking it is safe.

Example attacks:

SolarWinds attack
3CX attack

Supply chain attacks can affect thousands of systems at once.

These attacks are difficult to prevent.

SOC must detect suspicious activity after infection.

7. Importance of Patch Management

Patch management is the process of updating systems to fix vulnerabilities.

Without patching, attackers exploit known vulnerabilities easily.

Patch management reduces attack surface significantly.

SOC must monitor systems until patches are applied.

8. Importance of Proper System Configuration

Systems must be configured securely.

Secure configuration includes:

Strong passwords
Firewall enabled
Restricted access
Secure network configuration

Poor configuration leads to system compromise.

9. Antivirus and Endpoint Protection

Antivirus and EDR solutions protect systems by detecting and blocking malware.

Examples:

Microsoft Defender
CrowdStrike
SentinelOne

These tools monitor system processes and detect malicious behavior.

They prevent malware execution.

10. Network Protection

Network protection restricts system access to trusted users and networks.

Methods include:

Firewall configuration
IP access restrictions
Network segmentation

Restricting access reduces risk of unauthorized access.

11. Role of SOC Analyst in Protecting Systems

SOC analysts monitor systems continuously.

SOC responsibilities include:

Detecting suspicious system activity
Investigating security alerts
Identifying compromised systems
Responding to incidents
Monitoring vulnerability exploitation
Detecting malware infections

SOC uses tools such as:

SIEM
EDR
Log monitoring systems

SOC is responsible for detection and response.

12. Mitigation vs Detection

Mitigation focuses on preventing attacks.

Examples include:

Patch management
Secure configuration
Antivirus protection
Network protection

Detection focuses on identifying attacks that bypass mitigation.

SOC performs detection and investigation.

SOC is last line of defense.

13. Common System Attack Techniques

Attackers use:

Weak passwords
Malware
Vulnerability exploitation
Misconfigurations
Supply chain compromise

Attackers scan internet for exposed systems.

Tools like Shodan help attackers find vulnerable systems.

14. SOC Investigation Workflow for System Attacks

Attack occurs
System compromised
Security tools generate alert
SOC analyst investigates alert
SOC confirms compromise
SOC contains incident
SOC recommends mitigation

SOC protects organization infrastructure.
