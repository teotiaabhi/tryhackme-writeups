Human Element in Cyber Security — Raw Notes
1. Core Concept: Humans Are the Weakest Link

The most vulnerable part of any cybersecurity system is the human element, not the technology.

Attackers target humans because:

Humans trust easily

Humans make mistakes

Humans respond to urgency and fear

Humans can be manipulated psychologically

This attack method is called Social Engineering.

2. Social Engineering Definition

Social Engineering is a psychological attack where attackers manipulate people into performing actions that compromise security.

Instead of exploiting technical vulnerabilities, attackers exploit human behavior and emotions.

Goal of social engineering:

Steal credentials

Install malware

Gain unauthorized access

Bypass security controls

3. Psychological Principles Used in Social Engineering

Social engineering attacks rely on three main psychological triggers:

Trust

Attacker pretends to be a trusted entity such as:

IT department

Bank

Company executive

Government authority

Victim trusts attacker and follows instructions.

Urgency

Attacker creates pressure to force quick action.

Examples:

"Your account will be locked immediately"

"Urgent payment required"

Victim acts without thinking.

Fear or Curiosity

Attacker triggers emotional response.

Examples:

Fear: "Your system is compromised"

Curiosity: "You received a confidential document"

Victim interacts with malicious content.

4. Phishing Attacks

Phishing is the most common social engineering attack.

Definition:
Phishing is a fraudulent email or message designed to trick users into revealing credentials or installing malware.

Phishing attack flow:

Attacker sends fake email

Victim clicks malicious link or opens attachment

Victim enters credentials or runs malware

Attacker gains access

Common phishing indicators:

Fake sender domain

Suspicious links

Urgent or threatening language

Unexpected attachments

Impact:

Credential theft

Account compromise

Unauthorized access

5. Malware Delivery Attacks

Attackers trick users into installing malware disguised as legitimate software.

Common techniques:

Fake software updates
Fake browser updates
Malicious attachments
Fake downloads

Example:

Fake Firefox update downloads malware instead of real update.

Types of malware installed:

Data stealers

Keyloggers

Remote access trojans (RAT)

Ransomware

Impact:

Data theft

System compromise

Unauthorized remote access

6. Fake CAPTCHA Attacks

Attackers create fake CAPTCHA verification pages.

Victim is instructed to:

Press keyboard combinations

Execute commands

Download files

These actions execute malicious code.

Goal:

Install malware silently

7. Deepfake Attacks

Deepfakes use AI-generated audio or video to impersonate real people.

Attackers impersonate:

Company executives

Managers

Business partners

Example:

Finance employee receives deepfake video call from fake CEO requesting urgent payment.

Impact:

Financial loss

Credential compromise

Business compromise

8. Impersonation Attacks

Attackers pretend to be trusted individuals.

Examples:

Fake IT support calls
Fake managers
Fake HR personnel

Goal:

Obtain passwords

Gain access

Install malware

Example scenario:

Attacker calls employee pretending to be IT support and requests credentials.

9. Other Human-Targeted Attacks

Additional social engineering methods include:

USB drop attacks
Fake job offers
Physical impersonation
Insider threats

Example:

Malicious USB left in office. Employee inserts USB → malware installs.

10. Mitigation vs Detection

Cyber defense has two main components:

Mitigation
Detection

Mitigation Definition

Mitigation focuses on preventing attacks before they succeed.

Goal:

Reduce attack success rate

Protect users from common threats

Examples of mitigation controls:

Anti-phishing tools
Antivirus / EDR solutions
Security awareness training
Access controls

Mitigation reduces SOC workload.

Detection Definition

Detection focuses on identifying attacks that bypass mitigation.

SOC performs detection.

SOC detects:

Suspicious logins

Malware execution

Unusual activity

Unauthorized access

SOC investigates and responds to incidents.

SOC is last line of defense.

11. Anti-Phishing Solutions

Anti-phishing tools block phishing emails before users see them.

Functions:

Email filtering

Link scanning

Attachment scanning

Benefit:

Prevents credential theft.

12. Antivirus / EDR Solutions

Endpoint Detection and Response tools protect endpoints.

Functions:

Detect malware

Block malicious processes

Monitor system activity

Examples:

Microsoft Defender
CrowdStrike
SentinelOne

Benefit:

Prevents malware execution.

13. Security Awareness Training

Training employees to recognize attacks.

Employees learn to:

Identify phishing emails

Avoid suspicious links

Verify requests

Report suspicious activity

Benefit:

Reduces successful attacks.

14. Trust But Verify Principle

Employees must verify requests before acting.

Example:

If CEO requests urgent action, employee verifies authenticity before proceeding.

Prevents impersonation attacks.

15. Role of SOC Analyst in Human-Targeted Attacks

SOC analysts are responsible for detecting and investigating attacks.

SOC responsibilities include:

Monitoring security alerts
Investigating suspicious activity
Analyzing compromised accounts
Responding to incidents
Protecting organization

SOC analysts work with:

IT teams
HR teams
Security teams

SOC may also:

Recommend mitigation improvements
Assist with training
Help improve security posture

16. SOC Dashboard Investigation Role

SOC analysts investigate:

Employees at risk
Compromised accounts
Suspicious activity

SOC analysts also improve:

Security policies
Mitigation controls

SOC contributes to both detection and prevention.

17. Real-World Attack Flow Example

Attacker sends phishing email

Employee clicks malicious link

Malware installs

Malware communicates with attacker

SIEM detects suspicious activity

SOC investigates alert

SOC contains incident

18. Key SOC Analyst Learning Outcomes

Understanding social engineering attacks
Recognizing phishing techniques
Understanding malware delivery methods
Understanding mitigation vs detection
Understanding SOC role in incident detection
Understanding human risk in cybersecurity

19. Key Interview Concepts

Social Engineering = human manipulation attack

Phishing = fake email attack

Mitigation = prevention

Detection = SOC investigation

SOC role = detect and respond to attacks

Humans are primary attack vector

SOC is last line of defense
