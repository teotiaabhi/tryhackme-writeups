📘 Room: Identity, Assets, Network Context & SOC Workbooks

(Raw Study Notes – SOC L1 Focus)

1️⃣ Identity Inventory
Definition

Identity inventory = database of all corporate identities:

Employees (user accounts)

Service accounts

Machine accounts

Contains:

Full name

Role / Job title

Department

Manager

Working hours

Access privileges

Contact details

Why SOC Needs It

Used during alert triage to answer:

Who is this user?

Is this action normal for their role?

Is this within working hours?

Should they have access to this system?

Example Use Case

Alert: G.Baker accessed Finance Server.

Check:

Is G.Baker in Finance?

Does their role require financial file access?

Was access during normal hours?

If yes → Possibly normal
If no → Suspicious

Sources of Identity Inventory

Active Directory (On-prem AD, Entra ID)

SSO Providers (Okta, Google Workspace)

HR Systems (BambooHR, SAP)

Custom Excel/CSV maintained by IT

2️⃣ Asset Inventory
Definition

Asset inventory = list of all corporate IT assets (servers & workstations).

Contains:

Hostname

IP address

Subnet

Department owner

Purpose of server

Data stored

Installed software

Why SOC Needs It

To understand:

What is this server used for?

Is it sensitive?

Who should access it?

Example

HQ-FINFS-02

Breakdown:

HQ → Headquarters

FIN → Finance

FS → File Server

02 → Instance number

Likely stores:

Financial records

Accounting data

If Sales employee accesses it → Investigate.

Sources of Asset Inventory

Active Directory

SIEM / EDR (Elastic, CrowdStrike)

MDM (Intune, Jamf)

Custom Excel sheets

3️⃣ Network Diagrams
Definition

Visual map of:

Subnets

Firewall

Servers

VPN

Connections between networks

Why SOC Needs It

To understand:

What subnet an IP belongs to

What services are exposed

Attack path reconstruction

Lateral movement attempts

Example Scenario

External IP: 103.61.240.174
Port: TCP/10443

10443 = VPN service

Steps:

External IP brute forces VPN

Gets internal IP (10.10.0.53)

Scans Database subnet (172.16.15.0/24)

Scans Office subnet (172.16.23.0/24)

Interpretation:

Compromised VPN credentials

Internal reconnaissance

Lateral movement attempt

4️⃣ Enrichment Process
Definition

Enrichment = gathering additional context about:

User

Host

IP address

Using:

Identity inventory

Asset inventory

Threat Intelligence (TI)

SIEM logs

Goal:
Reduce uncertainty before verdict.

5️⃣ SOC Workbooks (Playbooks / Runbooks)
Definition

Structured investigation guide that defines:

Exact triage steps

Decision points

Escalation criteria

Created by:

Senior analysts (L2/L3)

Used mostly by:

SOC L1 Analysts

Workbook Structure
1️⃣ Enrichment

Check user in HR system (e.g., BambooHR)

Check IP in Threat Intel

Validate login location

2️⃣ Investigation

Check SIEM logs

Review user behavior

Check login history (e.g., 90 days)

Look for suspicious actions

3️⃣ Escalation

Close alert (if safe)

Contact user (if uncertain)

Escalate to L2 (if suspicious)

6️⃣ Email with Script/Binary Attachment Workbook Flow

Correct order:

Analyze email (SPF/DKIM/domain reputation)

Analyze attachment (sandbox/manual review)

Check recipient login activity

Gather triage evidence

Escalate to L2 (if malicious)

Do NOT:

Notify entire company without approval

Skip attachment analysis

Close alert without evidence

7️⃣ Core SOC L1 Thinking Model

Always ask:

WHO did it? (Identity)

WHAT system? (Asset)

WHERE in network? (Subnet/Diagram)

WHEN? (Time context)

WHY? (Business logic)

IS IT NORMAL for this role?

8️⃣ Key Concepts to Remember

Identity inventory gives user context.

Asset inventory gives system context.

Network diagram gives infrastructure context.

Enrichment reduces false positives.

Workbooks prevent missed steps.

L1 must follow structured process.

Never make verdict without evidence.
