SOC L1 Analyst & Blue Team — Professional Study Notes
1. Introduction to Blue Team
Definition

The Blue Team is the defensive cybersecurity team responsible for protecting an organization’s systems, network, and data from cyber threats and attacks.

Their primary objective is to:

Detect attacks

Prevent breaches

Respond to incidents

Monitor systems continuously

Protect organizational assets

Blue Team members act as the organization’s cybersecurity defenders.

Blue Team Responsibilities

Key functions include:

Security monitoring

Incident detection

Incident response

Log analysis

Threat detection

Threat hunting

System protection and hardening

Blue Team vs Red Team
Blue Team	Red Team
Defensive security	Offensive security
Protect systems	Attack systems (ethically)
Detect incidents	Simulate attacks
Monitor alerts	Find vulnerabilities
2. Organizational Security Hierarchy

Cybersecurity operates within a structured hierarchy in an organization.

Executive Level
CEO (Chief Executive Officer)

Responsible for overall business operations

Focuses on company strategy and growth

Does not manage technical cybersecurity directly

CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)

Head of cybersecurity

Responsible for overall security strategy

Designs and oversees security programs

Reports to CEO or executive leadership

Security Management Level
Security Manager / SOC Manager

Manages daily cybersecurity operations

Supervises SOC team

Handles incident escalation

Operational Level

This level includes technical cybersecurity staff such as:

SOC Analysts

Security Engineers

Incident Responders

Threat Intelligence Analysts

3. Security Departments in an Organization

Large organizations divide cybersecurity into specialized departments.

9. Internal SOC vs MSSP

Organizations may operate their own SOC or outsource to MSSP.

Internal SOC

Definition:
SOC operated inside the organization.

Characteristics:

Protects one organization

Lower pressure

Fewer tools

Stable environment

MSSP (Managed Security Services Provider)

Definition:
External company providing SOC services to multiple clients.

Characteristics:

Protects multiple organizations

Higher pressure

More alerts

Faster learning
