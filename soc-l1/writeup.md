TryHackMe

Overview

This room focused on understanding the structure of cybersecurity teams within an organization, especially the Blue Team and Security Operations Center (SOC). It covered SOC roles, incident response structure, security hierarchy, career progression, and how different defensive security teams collaborate to protect an organization from cyber threats.

Key Concepts Learned
Blue Team Fundamentals

Blue Team is responsible for defensive cybersecurity operations

Their main role is to detect, prevent, and respond to cyber attacks

Blue Team continuously monitors systems, logs, and network activity

SOC (Security Operations Center) is the core operational unit of the Blue Team

Security Hierarchy in an Organization

CEO is responsible for overall business operations

CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) leads cybersecurity strategy

SOC Manager supervises SOC team operations

SOC Analysts monitor and investigate security alerts

Security Engineers maintain and configure security tools

Hierarchy structure:

CEO → CISO → SOC Manager → SOC Engineer → SOC L2 Analyst → SOC L1 Analyst

SOC (Security Operations Center) Structure and Roles

SOC is the first line of defense against cyber threats.

SOC roles include:

SOC L1 Analyst:

Entry-level position

Monitors SIEM alerts

Performs alert triage

Escalates incidents to SOC L2

SOC L2 Analyst:

Investigates security incidents deeply

Performs malware analysis

Handles confirmed threats

SOC Engineer:

Configures and maintains SIEM and EDR tools

Creates detection rules

Troubleshoots security infrastructure issues

SOC Manager:

Manages SOC team

Oversees incident response process

Incident Response Team (CIRT / CERT)

Handles serious cyber incidents such as ransomware or breaches

Performs malware analysis and digital forensics

Responds to critical security incidents

Supports SOC during major attacks

Other Security Roles

Penetration Tester:

Identifies vulnerabilities in systems and applications

Simulates real-world attacks

Threat Intelligence Analyst:

Researches threat actors and attack techniques

Analyzes threat groups such as FIN7

GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) Auditor:

Ensures compliance with standards such as PCI DSS

Performs security audits

Develops security policies

Digital Forensics Analyst:

Investigates compromised systems

Collects digital evidence after incidents

Internal SOC vs MSSP

Internal SOC:

Protects a single organization

Uses fewer tools

Lower pressure environment

MSSP (Managed Security Services Provider):

Protects multiple client organizations

Handles large number of alerts

Faster learning environment

SOC Career Path

Typical career progression:

SOC L1 Analyst
SOC L2 Analyst
SOC Engineer / SOC L3 Analyst
Incident Responder / Threat Hunter
Security Architect
SOC Manager
CISO
